# A week (or so) with Emacs

So I managed to use Emacs for one whole week of full-time JavaScript work, whilst only falling back to Vim for the odd tweak of JSON or configuration, I count that as a success. It’s shifted my opinion of it since I set up my package management and JavaScript tooling, you can find all of this within [my dotfiles](https://github.com/Wolfy87/dotfiles/blob/master/emacs/init.el). It’s become far easier since I started to learn about vanilla Emacs key-bindings, the reason being that when I lost Evil mode for some buffers I was left high and dry.

The shift in mentality from my Vim workflow is interesting. I’ve moved away from tmux / tabs / splits and have begun leaning towards searching for buffers I want with [helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) and opening highly coupled files (such as tests) in splits. I’m yet to really use the terminal buffer, it doesn’t feel as smooth as my terminal + tmux combination yet. I’m also yet to get some form of git gutter and unimpaired style bindings set up. I haven’t managed to use it to resolve git conflicts yet either, I refer to Vim for that still. Git gutter doesn’t appear to work with my relative line numbers, there must be a way around it.

Now I’m going to start on my Clojure setup for use with [Brave Clojure](http://www.braveclojure.com/), we’ll see how that goes, I’d imagine rather well. Many thanks to those on twitter who convinced me to stick with it, I think it’s going to be great in the long run.
