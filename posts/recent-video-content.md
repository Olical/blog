# Recent video content

I’ve been slacking on the blogging front, sorry about that! But I haven’t been idle, I’ve been pushing out [Conjure](https://github.com/Olical/conjure) releases and speaking at conferences as much as possible. I thought I’d post _something_ here to prove I’m still around and still hacking around with weird Lisp-y ideas.

Here’s all of my recent-ish videos from my YouTube, with more to come in the future! Maybe I’ll write mini posts around videos in the future since a lot of the things I’m talking about are hard to write about but easy to show. Enjoy!

I hope at least some of these prove interesting and useful. Have a great day!
