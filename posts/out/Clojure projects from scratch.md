This post is intended _primarily_ for two groups of people:

1. People just starting out in Clojure, who know parts of the language but donâ€™t know how to begin structuring a real project.
2. Seasoned Clojurians who wish to see how to structure a project with the new Clojure CLI + `deps.edn` and not [lein](https://leiningen.org/) or [boot](http://boot-clj.com/) (even though theyâ€™re still awesome).

My goal is to teach you how to go from an empty directory, to a project you can run, test, compile and (if you wish to) publish with ease.
Weâ€™re going to get there through a series of relatively small steps so you can understand all the tools youâ€™re using.

There wonâ€™t be an awful lot of Clojure code here, so donâ€™t worry if youâ€™re still getting your head around the language itself.
The only code example will be a "Hello, World!", if that helps.

**ðŸ“Œ NOTE**\
This post assumes usage of Linux, OSX or similar, Iâ€™m afraid it isnâ€™t intended for Windows users since I just donâ€™t have the knowledge to help you there.
Some of the information will apply, but youâ€™ll have to adapt things, Iâ€™m sure you can find Windows specific guides for the parts that donâ€™t fit.

Iâ€™m not going into what editor you should use because thatâ€™s a book in itself.
If youâ€™re totally at a loss, check out [Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/), although I use [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) because I canâ€™t survive without good Vim emulation.
Thereâ€™s probably a great plugin for your editor of choice and instructions on getting started, have a Google.

A lot of what Iâ€™m going to be talking about can be found in practice in [github.com/robert-stuttaford/bridge](https://github.com/robert-stuttaford/bridge), you may want to have a peruse at some point.

## Installing the Clojure CLI

To run Clojure youâ€™ll need the command line tool (introduced around the time of Clojure 1.9) that manages dependencies and allows you execute code.

If youâ€™re on OSX, you can use `brew` to install the CLI.

```bash
$ brew install clojure
```

I have found that I could install it through the Arch Linux package manager although it was slightly out of date at the time of writing, so I donâ€™t recommend this just yet.
If youâ€™re on Linux you can run the manual installer easily enough.

```bash
$ curl -O https://download.clojure.org/install/linux-install-1.9.0.326.sh
$ sudo bash linux-install-1.9.0.326.sh
```

To update, use the package manager you used for the installation or find the latest Linux installer URL on the [getting started](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started) page.

You should now be able to drop into a Clojure REPL with one command.
You can run `clojure` or `clj` in your terminal, the latter has a slightly better editing experience but requires you to have `rlwrap` installed.

```bash
$ clj
Clojure 1.9.0
user=> (+ 10 15)
25
```

## Initial files

Presuming our project is called `hey`, letâ€™s go ahead and create these directories and files:

```bash
$ mkdir -p hey/{src/hey,test/hey}
$ cd hey
$ touch src/hey/core.clj test/hey/core_test.clj
```

This provides us with the following directory structure:

```console
$ tree
.
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hey
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ core.clj
â””â”€â”€ test
    â””â”€â”€ hey
        â””â”€â”€ core_test.clj

4 directories, 2 files
```

Letâ€™s insert some content into these files:

### src/hey/core.clj

```clojure
(ns hey.core)

(defn -main []
  (println "Hello, World!"))
```

### test/hey/core_test.clj

```clojure
(ns hey.core-test
  (:require [clojure.test :as t]
            [hey.core :as sut]))

(t/deftest basic-tests
  (t/testing "it says hello to everyone"
    (t/is (= (with-out-str (sut/-main)) "Hello, World!\n"))))
```

The main namespace simply prints "Hello, World!" when executed and the test confirms that functionality.

## Running your code

Now that we have a bare bones program and test file in our project directory, weâ€™re probably going to want to run it.
We can do that with the Clojure CLI, go ahead and execute the following:

```bash
$ clj -m hey.core
```

You should see "Hello, World!" printed in your terminal.
Letâ€™s try jumping into a REPL so we can interact with our code directly:

```bash
$ clj
Clojure 1.9.0
user=> (load "hey/core")
nil
user=> (in-ns 'hey.core)
#object[clojure.lang.Namespace 0x2072acb2 "hey.core"]
hey.core=> (-main)
Hello, World!
nil
```

If your editor supports Clojure, you can probably connect a REPL and interact with your code through there too.
With spacemacs I would type `,'` to "jack in" with CIDER.
I can then use `,ee` to evaluate expressions as I work.

## Testing

We have a test file but no way to run it.
We could create our own test runner namespace that executed `clojure.test/run-all-tests`, but that requires telling it about every testing namespace we have in our project.
It gets tedious after a while, so letâ€™s get something that does it for us.

Create a file called `deps.edn` at the top of your project and add the following to it:

### deps.edn

```clojure
{:deps
 {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.9.0"}}

 :aliases
 {:test
  {:extra-paths ["test"]
   :extra-deps
   {com.cognitect/test-runner {:git/url "https://github.com/cognitect-labs/test-runner"
                               :sha "5f2b5c2efb444df76fb5252102b33f542ebf7f58"}}
   :main-opts ["-m" "cognitect.test-runner"]}}}
```

Letâ€™s break this down:

* `:deps` is where we specify our dependencies, right now all weâ€™re depending on is Clojure 1.9.0.
* `:aliases` is where we specify special overrides that we can apply with the `-A` argument to the CLI.
* `:test` is the name of our alias, it adds the `test` directory to the paths list and `com.cognitect/test-runner` to the dependencies.
* `:main-opts` instructs Clojure that we want these arguments applied when the alias is active.
In this case, weâ€™re using `-m` to specify which namespace to execute.

The usage of `deps.edn` is documented further in [the deps guide](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli).

This will discover and run our test for us, letâ€™s run it now:

```bash
$ clj -Atest

Running tests in #{"test"}

Testing hey.core-test

Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.
```

Hopefully you see the same success message as myself.
You can see that we applied the values specified in our alias with the `-Atest` argument.

## Building executable jars

In this section weâ€™re going to build an "uberjar" containing your application alongside all of the dependencies it requires to run.

> You only need to bother with uberjars if youâ€™re writing an application you wish to deploy and run somewhere.
> If youâ€™re building a library for others to depend on you probably wonâ€™t need this.

Compiling your project into an uberjar will involve similar steps to getting your tests running, weâ€™re going to add another alias with another dependency which does the job for us.

Go ahead and add this new alias to the `:aliases` section of your `deps.edn` file, next to the `:test` alias:

```clojure
:uberjar
{:extra-deps
 {pack/pack.alpha
  {:git/url "https://github.com/juxt/pack.alpha.git"
   :sha     "e6d0691c5f58135e1ef6fb1c9dda563611d36205"}}
 :main-opts ["-m" "mach.pack.alpha.capsule" "deps.edn" "dist/hey.jar"]}
```

We can now build a jar that we can execute directly through the `java` program, without the Clojure CLI:

```bash
$ clj -Auberjar
$ java -jar dist/hey.jar # Drops us into a Clojure REPL.
$ java -jar dist/hey.jar -m hey.core # Executes our "Hello, World!".
```

Please note that your code has not been AOT (ahead of time) compiled, itâ€™s still just plain Clojure thatâ€™s compiled as and when itâ€™s required at run time.
This can mean very slightly slower startup times when youâ€™re working with a large codebase.

If this becomes an issue for you youâ€™ll have to work out how to perform AOT compilation as you build your uberjar.
By then, pack may even support it as a core feature.

## Publishing to Clojars

In this section weâ€™re going to publish a small jar file to [Clojars](https://clojars.org/) containing only your source code, weâ€™ll be using maven to perform the deploy.

> This is intended for libraries that others will depend on and use, you wonâ€™t need to worry about this section if youâ€™re building an application youâ€™ll be running.

First, weâ€™re going to add your Clojars login to `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

```xml
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>clojars</id>
      <username>username</username>
      <password>password</password>
    </server>
  </servers>
</settings>
```

Now weâ€™re going to generate your base `pom.xml` file, you should run this command whenever youâ€™re going to publish so the dependencies get updated:

```bash
$ clj -Spom
```

Hereâ€™s my example version, Iâ€™ve annotated each section.
Thereâ€™s some youâ€™ll want to change as well as a couple of parts youâ€™ll want to add and update:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

  <!-- Here by default, but will need updating -->
  <groupId>org.clojars.olical</groupId>
  <artifactId>hey</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
  <name>hey</name>

  <!-- Here by default, updated by `clj -Spom` -->
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.clojure</groupId>
      <artifactId>clojure</artifactId>
      <version>1.9.0</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  <build>
    <sourceDirectory>src</sourceDirectory>

    <!-- Essential for bundling your source files into the JAR -->
    <resources>
      <resource>
        <directory>src</directory>
      </resource>
    </resources>
  </build>
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>clojars</id>
      <url>https://clojars.org/repo</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>

  <!-- Essential for pushing to Clojars -->
  <distributionManagement>
    <repository>
      <id>clojars</id>
      <name>Clojars repository</name>
      <url>https://clojars.org/repo</url>
    </repository>
  </distributionManagement>

  <!-- Optional extras for Clojars -->

```

We can now tell maven to build and deploy a jar to Clojars:

```bash
$ mvn deploy
```

A lot of this information comes from [Clojarâ€™s guide to pushing](https://github.com/clojars/clojars-web/wiki/Pushing) and [Mavenâ€™s guide to deploying 3rd party jars](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-remote.html).

If everything went to plan, your Clojars account should now contain a fresh new jar.
Note that this is _not_ an uberjar, it only contains your source files and dependency information, not the actual dependencies themselves.
The dependencies will be resolved by a tool such as the Clojure CLI.

## Ergonomics

As it stands, to deploy our jar to Clojars weâ€™ll want to take the following steps:

* Update the version number in our `pom.xml`.
* Run the tests with `clj -Atest`.
* Run `clj -Spom` to update our `pom.xml` with any dependency changes.
* Run `mvn deploy`.

This isnâ€™t particularly catchy, so weâ€™ll wrap everything weâ€™ve seen so far in a pretty little `Makefile`:

```makefile
.PHONY: run test uberjar deploy

run:
	clj -m hey.core

test:
	clj -Atest

uberjar:
	clj -Auberjar

deploy: test
	clj -Spom
	mvn deploy
```

Now all you need to do when you wish to deploy is bump the version number in your `pom.xml` and execute `make deploy`.

## Thanks!

I really hope this post has helped you out!
You can find the example project I built during the writing of this post at [github.com/Olical/clojure-hey-example](https://github.com/Olical/clojure-hey-example) and the [Clojars page here](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.olical/hey/versions/2.1.0-SNAPSHOT).

Happy Clojuring!
