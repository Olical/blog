# vim-expand, my second {plugin,bundle}!

So I just pushed up my second ever Vim plugin, [vim-expand](https://github.com/Wolfy87/vim-expand). It allows you to expand things like \{foo,bar}, \{1..10} and $HOME inline with a single command. It’s not just limited to single lines though, you can also execute it on a visual range! Here’s a quick video of it in action.

There’s way more information in the repository, so have a read through that. I hope it comes in useful for others some day, it’s been useful for me a few times already!
